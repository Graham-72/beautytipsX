# Beautytips

The Beautytips module provides balloon-style help tooltips for any page
element by integrating the BeautyTips jQuery Tooltip plugin by 
Jeff Robbins with Backdrop. 

It provides an API for adding custom beautytips as well as some 
built-in features. Admins can enable rollover balloon-help style 
tooltips for text fields within forms. It also supplies hover tips 
for Backdrop help links and advanced help links.

Most importantly, it allows developers to add their own custom 
beautytips popups to their site without having to delve into jQuery.

This is a port from the Drupal module of the same name.

This port to Backdrop would not, of course, be possible without all
the work done by the developers and maintainers of the Drupal module.
